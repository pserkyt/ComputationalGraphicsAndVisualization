# ComputationalGraphicsAndVisualization
## CS330 - Southern New Hampshire University - Final Project
by Cameron Winningham aka Pserkyt

## How do I approach designing software?
### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped reinforce my code organization skills, my OpenGL skills, and my cross-platform programming skills.
### What design process did you follow for your project work?
Since the project required a Windows executable with Visual Studio 2019 solution files, and I only currently have a Mac, I started designing the application on my Mac. After I completed the project on my Mac, I uploaded it to the SNHU Virtual Lab where I created a Visual Studio 2019 solution, made a couple small changes to the code as necessary, then compiled. I then downloaded the Windows version of the project, zipped it up, and submitted it.
### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I could absolutely use the organizational and cross-platform approaches I used here in future projects.

## How do I approach developing programs?
### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
In previous OpenGL projects, I always used 3D models to represent objects in the scene. This time around, I used only primitives (cube, pyramid, sphere, etc) to represent all of the objects in the scene.
### How did iteration factor into your development?
Since the project was submitted in iterations each week, it gave me plenty of time to focus on only what was required for that iteration such as textures or lighting.
### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approached remained the same: get the code working first, then clean, comment, and organize.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
The programming skills and knowledge gained from this course can be utilized in any future computer science courses.
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Professionally, the knowledge and skills gained can be used in any programming career, especially jobs focused on computational graphics and visualizations.
